# Quickstart :: Async Request Reply

This basic app demonstrates how to implement an action poll when you have a long running action.
In this case, long running means 200 seconds, much longer than the 30-60 timeout for a web-action.

The web action `polling` will invoke the non-web worker action `long-running` and return an `activationId`

Subsequent `polling` calls should include the`{activationId:<activationId>}` so `polling` can check the activation record for a result.  Upon completion, `polling` will return the result of `activationId`

You can install and run this app yourself!

    aio app init --repo adobe/appbuilder-quickstarts/async-request-reply
