Contributions are welcomed! Read the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

Each directory is a self-contained starter app that can be used to demonstrate features or methods.  These apps may be starting points only, or full app projects with tests, ci/cd setups, etc.

Every quick-start should contain a README.md outlining what it does, how it works, why it matters, and how to use it.
